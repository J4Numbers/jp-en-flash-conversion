# JP - EN flash card conversions

A project to help with converting to and from Japanese to
English with the use of a flash card-like interface on a
website.

This project will hold an increasing set of flash cards for
hiragana, katakana, and kanji as time goes on (probably with
an interface to include different packs as time goes on).
